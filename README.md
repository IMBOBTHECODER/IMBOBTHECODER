# im gonna explode
coding is very special 😜, it's like a roulette gun. sometimes ur adhd ahh brain gonna get a burst of dopamine, sometimes you gonna rethink ur life decision. even though i've been programming for quite some time, i don't have much intent in computer science later on since the average CS uni student is probably gonna become a femboy dancing to tiktok music in the future. oh btw, **im bob**, and i like to code weird shit js for the fun of it.
