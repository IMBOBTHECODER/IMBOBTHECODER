Greetings, my fellow companions, my name is Albert, which you can also refer to me as Bob. I discovered my passion for computer science and programming when I was pursuing my passion of mathematics. Since then, I fell in love with the fascinating world of complex algorithms, diverse functions, and arrays. I quickly study coding, from Python, HTML, and CSS to Lua, PHP and much more. And then, I found GitHub. This was essential to my journey for knowledge, as this allowed me to access and share an enormous quantity of projects and applications.
